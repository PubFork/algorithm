## Merge Sort

A Merge Sort works as follows:
1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element(a list of one element is considered sorted).   
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.This will be the sorted list.  

* Data structure:Array or list  
* Worst-case performance:O(nlogn)  
* Best-case performance:O(nlogn)  
* Average performance:O(nlogn)  
* Worst-case space complexity:O(n) total with O(n) auxiliary, O(1) auxiliary with linked lists.
